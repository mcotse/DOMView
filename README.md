# DOMView

A lightweight DOM wrapper for creating object-oriented view classes!

## Setting up your environment
Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (currently using v4.4.4) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed

Once you have that set up, all you need to do is run

```
npm install
```
