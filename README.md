# DOMView

A lightweight DOM wrapper for creating object-oriented view classes!

An example for the implementation of a view class can be found in `example/Slider.js`. You see a [live demo here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ydxia/domview/blob/master/example/static/index.html).

## Making changes
Make sure you have [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (currently using v4.4.4) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed

Once you have that set up, all you need to do is run

```
npm install
```

Rebuilding DOMView changes into an ES5-friendly format can be done with

```
npm run transpile
```

The sample app is built with webpack. Rebuilding the sample app can be done by running
```
npm run build-example
```
